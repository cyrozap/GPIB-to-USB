# GPIB-to-USB

~~This is a simple USB GPIB adapter based on an STM32. It uses the USB488
subclass of the USBTMC USB class specification in order to achieve driverless
compatability with software that supports those protocols.~~

I never completed this project. Only a small part of the schematics were drawn,
mainly just the STM32 and its supporting components, and I never committed them
to this repo. No board layout was done, and no firmware was written. Maybe
someday I'll revive this project, but I'm archiving it for now.

If you need an inexpensive, open source USB GPIB adapter,
[this one][xyphro/UsbGpib] looks good. The repository even includes a
3D-printable design for an enclosure for the device.
